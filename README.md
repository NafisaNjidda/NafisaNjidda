## Hi there,

I'm Nafisa, a student in the construction field with a passion for technology that knows no bounds. The fascinating world of tech has always captivated me, particularly the realm of cybersecurity. There is something thrilling about learning how to protect systems and networks from potential threats.

As i delve deeper into the world of cybersecurity, i am excited about the prospect of making a meaningful impact. With the growing demand for security professionals, i am eager to contribute my skills and expertise to this critical field. What is even more exciting is the potential to merge my cybersecurity skills with my construction background. The construction industry's adoption of smart technologies has transformed the way we live and work. However, this increased connectivity also introduces new cybersecurity risks. I envision a future a future where i can help secure the construction industry's digital landscape, protecting valuable data and infrastructure from cyber threats and exploring the security aspects of smart homes, Building Automation Systems, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The thought of combining these two passions fills me joy.

My immediate goal is to excel in my 1-year diploma course with Alt School Africa. I am committed to not only completing the program but also achieving outstanding results. Beyond that, i aspire to work with multiple companies, not limited to construction companies, but all those that require cybersecurity expertise, offering top-notch security services and establishing myself as a renowed expert in the field.

To further enhance my skills, I am also currently learning networking on Cisco and plan to enroll in the Google Cybersecurity Program right after. I am excited about the opportuinities that lie ahead and look forward to connecting with professionals in the cybersecurity field and to also learn from their experiences.
